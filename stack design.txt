// similar to linkedlist you can declare a new stack
// create an array of richest people in the world
// create a for loop to print the array of people
// now check to see if the stack is empty

// use the for loop to push the array into the stack
// check for emptiness 
// check the size
// peek at the stack to see whos on top of it

// create a new array (call it whatever you want)
// create another for loop to pop the stack into the new array

// stack class

/** This stack class has a stack pointer and the size of the stack. This stack has methods to:
 * Push a new element onto a stack
 * Pop an element off the stack and return the data in the element
 * Print a list of the data in the stack
 * Return the current size of stack
 */

// have properties such as top of the list and count
// have to an empty stack method
// a method to find the size of the stack 
// create a push method 
 /* this method pushes a new element onto a stack
   *this method should put data onto the stack, which means it must first put thedata in a stack element
   */
//create a pop method
 /* this method pop an element off the stack and return the data in the element
     * this method uses a temp variable to get the data from the list

// create a peek method
 /* This method returns the items most recently added to the stack
    *  Throws an exception if theres no such items exist

// print the stack

// stackElement class
// create constructors, get and set methods for the data and the stackElement next
